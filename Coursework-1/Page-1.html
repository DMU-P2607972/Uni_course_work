        <h1>Synopsis</h1>
        <p> An unnamed CIA agent, the "Protagonist", participates in an undercover operation at a Kyiv opera house.
            He is aided by a masked soldier with a distinctive trinket, who appears to "un-fire" a bullet through a
            hostile gunman. After seizing a strange artifact, the Protagonist is captured by mercenaries.
            He endures torture before consuming a cyanide pill. He awakens to learn the pill was a test of his
            loyalty; his team has been killed and the artifact lost.
            <br><br>
            The Protagonist is now employed by a secret organization called Tenet. A scientist shows him bullets
            with "inverted" entropy which allows them to move backwards through time. She believes they are
            manufactured in the future, and a weapon exists that can wipe out the past. Aided by a local contact,
            Neil, the Protagonist traces the bullet cartridges to arms dealer Priya Singh. He discovers she is a
            member of Tenet; her cartridges were purchased and time-inverted by Russian oligarch Andrei Sator.
            <br><br>
            Tenet tracks the assembled algorithm to Sator's hometown of Stalsk-12 in Northern Siberia. In a
            "temporal pincer movement", red team troops move forward in time, while the blue team troops move
            backward. The Protagonist and Ives are aided by a masked corpse with a trinket on its backpack that
            returns to life. In Vietnam, Kat boards Sator's yacht and kills him as the Protagonist and Ives secure
            the algorithm.
            <br><br>
            The Protagonist, Neil, and Ives break up the algorithm and part ways. The Protagonist notices a trinket
            on Neil's rucksack. Neil reveals that he was recruited by the Protagonist years earlier, and this
            mission is the end of a long friendship. Priya attempts to have Kat assassinated, but is killed by the
            Protagonist, who has realised that he is the future mastermind behind Tenet.</p>
