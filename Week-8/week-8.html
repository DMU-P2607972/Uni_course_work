        <p>The task for the week 8 laboratory work has said to make a good
         long paragraph after the image that it said to insert previously.
         So to make this paragraph long I will just type a few more words
        and talk about a picture of this lovely happy doggo that I am hoping
        going to brighten your day. However I need lots and lots more text
        to put in here in order to wrap the image fully so I m going to
        copy and paste what I have already written twice.
