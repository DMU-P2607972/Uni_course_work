    <title>Dogs Become Valuable Employees at Bank</title>
    <h1>Dogs Become Valuable Employees at Bank</h1>
  </head>
  <body>

    <p>It was revealed this morning that a major high street bank has
    <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to perform basic data-entry
    tasks in several of its UK data centres. In a statement earlier today a
    spokesperson for the bank said that training had gone well with the
    <strong>first intake of ten pooches</strong> and that overall they were
    just happy to be involved.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"I've made new friends, we have a great canteen, and in a few months
        I'll have earned enough for a deposit on my own kennel"</p>

    <h4>Top three reasons dogs decided to work for the bank</h4>

    <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
    <li>Dogs reduce stress and boost reduce</li>
    <li>Dogs boost productivity</li>
    <li>Dogs reduce sick days</li></ol>

    <h2>Businesses Suited to Animal Employees</h2>
    <p>Many busnesses could benefit from embracing our feathered and furry
      friends in the workspace.</p>
    <h3>Cafes</h3>
    <p>Perhaps you've been to a cat cafe already? Relax with a coffee
    and be soothed by the elegant slow dance and soft purring of some feline
    friends.</p>
    <h3>Hospitals</h3>
    <p>Hospitals often have a need to move small things like sample tubes and
      paperwork to other parts of the hospital quickly, often along long narrow
      corridors. Parrots would be perfectly suited to this role, and would also
      help brighten things up, adding a little cheer for those enjoying a
      temporary stay.</p>
    <h3>Window Cleaning</h3>
    <p>If window cleaners used Pelicans to hold their water, instead of
      carrying a bucket up a ladder, it's estimated that 356 window cleaning
      injuries a year could be avoided. They're also good company on a lunch
      break.</p>
